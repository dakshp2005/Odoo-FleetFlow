## 🤖 AI Assistant

The embedded AI assistant uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** via the Vercel AI SDK. It can:

- **Query** fleet data — _"Which vehicles are currently available?"_
- **Create** records — _"Add driver Ravi Kumar with license DL-XX-2027"_
- **Update** statuses — _"Mark Trip #42 as completed"_
- **Analyze** data — _"Show me fuel efficiency for last month"_

The assistant operates with secure server-side data access, ensuring sensitive operations are never exposed to the client.
